# How to install
Currently, you have to install this extension as a temporary debug extension.
That means:
1. download this repository
2. go to `Manage Extensions`
3. settings wheel
4. debug addon
5. load temporary addon
6. select the `manifset.json` from this repository.
Then it should be installed.

# How to use
1. visit [www.ebay.de](www.ebay.de)
2. perform a search
3. open extension popup
4. press the `add listings` button
5. go back to 2 for adding more listings or take a look at the charts

I recommend using the `advanced search` and increasing the **number of listings per page** to 240.
Additionally, you could choose to display only **sold listings** and exclude terms linked to other articles.
Sorting by end time could be useful too.

# Limitations
Non auction listings, like sell offers, ads or commercial offeres, are ignored.
We assumed that auction pricing carries the most valuable insights.

Notation used for listings varies between different listings and languages.
This makes price extraction for different languages espacially difficult.
Therefore, only `german` is supported.

The most common date and price formats, we could find, are supported.
Formats we couldn't find are therefore ignored to prevent unexpected results.

Listings from users with a negative amount of ratings are ignored since they would affect the rating vs price diagram.
